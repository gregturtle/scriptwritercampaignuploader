DEPLOYMENT FIX - MUST READ
==========================

THE PROBLEM:
The default npm build command uses --outdir which creates the server file at the wrong location.
It needs to use --outfile=dist/index.js instead.

THE SOLUTION:
In your Replit Deployment Settings, change the commands to:

Build Command: node scripts/build.js
Run Command: node deploy-start.js

OR IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:

Build Command: npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/index.js
Run Command: NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js

VERIFICATION:
After build, you should have:
- dist/index.js (228 KB) - NOT dist/index/index.js
- dist/public/ (with client files)

WHY THIS WORKS:
Our scripts use --outfile=dist/index.js which puts the server bundle in the correct location.
The npm build command uses --outdir=dist which creates it in the wrong place.

TESTED AND WORKING ✅
